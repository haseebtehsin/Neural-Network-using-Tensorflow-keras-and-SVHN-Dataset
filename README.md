# Neural-Network-using-Tensorflow-keras-and-SVHN-Dataset
### A simple implementation of Deep neural network for image pattern recognition using keras and SVHN dataset. 
Data is first transformed into grayscale and also given a shape to match format in the Tensorflow tutorial for easy implementation
